## User Management Dashboard

Develop a simple web application where users can view, add, edit, and delete user details
from a mock backend API.


## Functionality:

- View  : Display all users by fetching data from the '/users' endpoint.
- Add   : To allow adding a new user.
- Edit  : Allow editing an existing user. This should involve fetching the current data for a user, allowing for edits.
- Delete: Allow users to be deleted, by sending a delete request to the API.
- Implement pagination for the user list.
